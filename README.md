# Bit-by-Byte

## Overview

Welcome to **Bit-by-Byte**, a personal project where I explore and deepen my understanding of low-level programming concepts using C and C++. This project is designed to track my learning journey as I tackle various topics in programming, taking them step by step.

The name "Bit-by-Byte" reflects my approach to learning: I make steady progress by focusing on the fundamentals, incrementally building my knowledge one small step at a time.

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to:

- **Learn low-level programming**: Delve into the core concepts of memory management, data structures, algorithms, and system-level programming.
- **Track learning progress**: Each directory in the repository corresponds to a topic or concept I've explored, where I implement various exercises to reinforce my understanding of the concepts.
- **Build skills in C and C++**: Through hands-on coding exercises, I work on sharpening my skills in these languages, which are essential for understanding low-level operations.

## Content

The repository is organized into various sections, each focusing on different aspects of low-level programming. As I progress through different topics, I continue to add new material to this project.

## Philosophy

This project is about continuous learning. By breaking down complex topics into manageable pieces, I am able to gain a deeper understanding over time. Each new concept is an opportunity for growth.
